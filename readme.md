### Autorest plugin configuration
- Please don't edit this section unless you're re-configuring how the powershell extension plugs in to AutoRest
AutoRest needs the below config to pick this up as a plug-in - see https://github.com/Azure/autorest/blob/master/docs/developer/architecture/AutoRest-extension.md


#### Javagen

``` yaml
use-extension:
  "@autorest/modelerfour": "~4.0.10"

pipeline:

# --- extension remodeler ---

  # "Shake the tree", and normalize the model
  modelerfour:
    input: openapi-document/multi-api/identity     # the plugin where we get inputs from
  
  # allow developer to do transformations on the code model.
  modelerfour/new-transform:
    input: modelerfour

  javagen:
